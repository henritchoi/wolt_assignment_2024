Welcome to Henri's DBT project for the 2024 Analytics Engineer Wolt Assignment!

The assignment revolves around a business problem, the reduction of delivery radiuses, and relies on 3 base datasets (purchases, delivery_radius_log and hours).

In this DBT repository would be housed all models related to this assignment, with a basic showcase of how I would set things up.
